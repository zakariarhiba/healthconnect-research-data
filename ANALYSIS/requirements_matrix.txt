########################################SUMMARY SCORECARD
########################################
LAMBDA ARCHITECTURE: 17/18 (94.4%)
Passes: All requirements except operational simplicity
Trade-off: Complexity justified by comprehensive functionality

MQTT ARCHITECTURE: 6/18 (33.3%)
Passes: Latency, security, auth, fault tolerance, cloud-native
Fails: Throughput, scalability, data loss, analytics

COAP ARCHITECTURE: 5/18 (27.8%)
Passes: Security, auth, operational simplicity, cloud-native (partial)
Fails: Latency, throughput, scalability, analytics

HTTP ARCHITECTURE: 3/18 (16.7%)
Passes: Security, auth, operational simplicity
Fails: Almost all performance and scalability requirements

########################################CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
########################################
8 requirements are marked as CRITICAL for healthcare:
1. Real-time Latency (REQ-01)
2. Data Durability (REQ-02)
3. Scalability (REQ-04)
4. Zero Data Loss (REQ-05)
5. Fault Tolerance (REQ-09)
6. Security (REQ-11)
7. Authentication (REQ-12)
8. Anomaly Detection (REQ-15)

Performance on CRITICAL Requirements:

Lambda: 8/8 (100%) - ALL critical requirements satisfied
MQTT:   4/8 (50%)  - Missing scalability, zero data loss, anomaly detection
CoAP:   3/8 (37.5%) - Missing latency, scalability, zero data loss, anomaly detection
HTTP:   2/8 (25%)  - Missing latency, durability, scalability, zero data loss, fault tolerance, anomaly detection

########################################ARCHITECTURAL TRADE-OFFS
########################################
LAMBDA ARCHITECTURE
Strengths: Comprehensive functionality, best performance
Weaknesses: Operational complexity, learning curve
Best For: National-scale telemedicine, mission-critical systems

MQTT ARCHITECTURE
Strengths: Simple, lightweight, good for IoT
Weaknesses: Limited scalability, no analytics, data loss
Best For: Small clinics (<10K patients), non-critical monitoring

COAP ARCHITECTURE
Strengths: Lightweight, constrained devices, low power
Weaknesses: Poor scalability, high latency, immature ecosystem
Best For: Battery-powered wearables (limited use cases)

HTTP ARCHITECTURE
Strengths: Universal, simple, well-understood
Weaknesses: Poor performance, stateless, no real-time support
Best For: Administrative dashboards, low-frequency queries

########################################RECOMMENDATION
########################################
For national-scale telemedicine deployment supporting 195,000
patients with real-time vital sign monitoring:

RECOMMENDED: Lambda Architecture

Justification:
- ONLY architecture passing all 8 critical requirements
- 94.4% overall requirement satisfaction
- Proven performance: 185ms latency, 0% data loss, 500K+ devices
- Trade-off (complexity) is acceptable for mission-critical healthcare

Alternative architectures are NOT VIABLE for this scale and
criticality level.
